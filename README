= WiiPresent - Presentations using the Wiimote

WiiPresent is a small program that enables you to use a Nintendo Wiimote
for giving presentations using Open Office, xpdf, evince or Acrobat Reader.
It was designed as an off-the-shelf tool with no need to customize it.

But WiiPresent can also control multimedia applications or firefox.
It does this by translating WiiMote events into keypresses for applications.

== Reasons for using a Wiimote for presentations
There were quite a few compelling reasons for using a Wiimote for giving
presentations:

 - the same features as most of the advanced presentation devices

 - is much cheaper (40 EUR) than those advanced presentation devices (>80 EUR)

 - has an open and documented interface where some advanced devices do not
   work in Linux

 - uses bluetooth which is common on laptops nowadays, but small USB bluetooth
   receivers are quite cheap (10 EUR)

 - works very reliably even in a big exhibition hall (LinuxTag 2008) with
   thousands of people and booths with as many bluetooth devices. We even left
   the exhbition room and we were still able to control our laptop at the
   CentOS booth (witness references on request :-))

 - fancy silicon covers exist in various colors matching your outfit are
   available from Ebay

 - at least one person attributes finding a girlfriend by using the wiimote in
   a public area (name witheld because of privacy concerns)

 - they come with a wrist-cord (and anti-slip coating) for vivid, animated
   presenters using lots of gestures


== Build requirements
You need the following libraries in order to build and use WiiPresent:

 - Xorg libX11 and libXtst libraries and headers
 - BlueZ libraries and headers
 - libwiimote libraries and headers (built with -D_DISABLE_NONBLOCK_UPDATES)

We tried to minimize the dependencies that WiiPresent needs.
