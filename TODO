= WiiPresent

== Ideas
- Rumble/flash lights when battery low
- Make sound when presentation is over
- Record timings and print timestamp + keypress
- Follow keypresses so we know on what slide we are too
- Make the mouse pointer move based on IR data
- Make the mouse buttons do the right thing
- Implement the power button to disconnect the device cleanly
  (this is a bug in libwiimote)

== OpenOffice keymaps
 - left/right: change slide/channel/tab
 - up/down: change volume
 - -/+: change workspace
 - 1: fullscreen
 - 2: blank screen/mute audio
 - B: enable mouse pointer
 - home: exit
 - exit/A: unused
