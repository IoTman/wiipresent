= WiiPresent

== Ideas
- Rumble/flash lights when battery low
- Make sound when presentation is over
- Option to select keymap for OpenOffice, evince, xpdf, acrobat reader, ...
- Record timings and print timestamp + keypress
- Follow keypresses so we know on what slide we are too
- Make the mouse pointer move based on IR data
- Implement the power button (to disconnect the device)

== OpenOffice keymaps
 - A: move mouse pointer
 - left/right: change slide
 - up/down: fullscreen/minimize
 - -/+: change workspace
 - 1: blank screen
 - power: exit
 - home/2/A/B: unused
