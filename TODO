= WiiPresent

== Ideas
- Rumble/flash lights when battery low
- Make sound when presentation is over
- Record timings and print timestamp + keypress
  (follow keypresses so we know on what slide we are too)
- Make the mouse pointer move based on IR data (use WMD implementation)
- Report when batteries of IR sensorbar are low
  (calculate distance and compare with dot strength)
- Implement the power button to disconnect the device cleanly
  (this is a bug in libwiimote)
- Use playertoggle to switch between skip forward and next playback
- On disconnect, wait for reconnect
- Scan for wiimotes and pick the closest nearby if more than one
- Implement on-screen writing as replacement for laser

== Bugs
- Known bug where some applications are causing a BadWindow error
  - vlc when going into fullscreen
- Applications loosing focus
  - qiv in fullscreenA

== Bugs in libwiimote
- Battery status updates do not seem to work ?
- Infrared only works when acceleration sensors are enabled
