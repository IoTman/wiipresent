= WiiPresent

== Ideas
- Rumble/flash lights when battery low
- Make sound when presentation is over
- Record timings and print timestamp + keypress
  (follow keypresses so we know on what slide we are too)
- Make the mouse pointer move based on IR data
- Implement the power button to disconnect the device cleanly
  (this is a bug in libwiimote)
- Use playertoggle to switch between skip forward and next playback
- On disconnect, wait for reconnect
- Scan for wiimotes and pick the closest nearby if more than one
- Implement better mouse-mode that does not need B-button pressed
  (both A+B could enable en disable mouse-mode, with leds indicating)

== OpenOffice keymaps
- left/right: change slide/channel/tab
- up/down: change volume
- -/+: change workspace
- 1: fullscreen
- 2: blank screen/mute audio
- A: Play/Pause
- B: enable mouse pointer
- home: back/home
- exit: unavailable

== Bugs
- Known bug where some applications are causing a BadWindow error
  - vlc when going into fullscreen
- Applications loosing focus
  - qiv in fullscreen
- Battery status updates do not seem to work ?
