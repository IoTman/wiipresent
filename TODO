= WiiPresent

== Priorities
- Make the mouse pointer move based on IR data (use WMD implementation)
  (should probably go into libwiimote)
- Scan for wiimotes and pick the closest (< rssi) nearby if more than one
  (should probably go into libwiimote)
- Check if bluetooth device is in fact a wiimote
  (bluetooth name should be 'Nintendo RVL-CNT-01')
- Put keycode configuration in seperate config-files that are activated
  when mouseover application

== Ideas
- Rumble/flash lights when battery low
- Make sound when presentation is over
- Record timings and print timestamp + keypress
  (follow keypresses so we know on what slide we are too)
- Report when batteries of IR sensorbar are low
  (calculate distance and compare with dot strength)
- Implement the power button to disconnect the device cleanly
  (this is a bug in libwiimote)
- Use playertoggle to switch between skip forward and next playback
- Implement on-screen writing as replacement for laser
  (needs IR working for making this practical)
- Auto-disconnect option to safe batteries (eg. when used as remote)
  (and fast auto-reconnect)

== Bugs
- Known bug where for the root window (0x01) we find no application name
  - qiv and vlc when going into fullscreen

== Bugs in libwiimote
- Battery status updates do not seem to work ?
- Infrared only works when acceleration sensors are enabled
- Unable to capture when wiimote is turned off

== Features for libwiimote
- Functionality to verify or get the Wiimote name
- Functionality to scan for wiimotes is missing
- Absolute positions for infrared handling is missing
