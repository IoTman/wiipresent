= WiiPresent

== Ideas

- Rumble when battery low
- Rumble-pulse after 15min, 30min, 45min, then rumble every min
- Use leds to indicate time
- Make sound when presentation is over
- Option to select keymap for OpenOffice, evince, xpdf, acrobat reader, ...
- Record timings and print timestamp + keypress
- Follow keypresses so we know on what slide we are too
